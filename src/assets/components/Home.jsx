      <br></br><h2>Web Application</h2><br></br>
      <br></br>A web application is software that runs in your web browser. Businesses
       have to exchange information and deliver services remotely. They use
        web applications to connect with customers conveniently and securely.
         The most common website features like shopping carts, product search 
         and filtering, instant messaging, and social media newsfeeds are web
          applications in their design. They allow you to access complex 
          functionality without installing or configuring software.

      <h2>What are the benefits of web applications?</h2><br></br>
      As detailed, the development process for web apps is relatively 
      simple and cost-effective for businesses. Small teams can achieve 
      short development cycles, making web applications an efficient 
       affordable method of building computer programs. In addition, because
        the same version works across all modern browsers and devices,
         you won't have to create several different iterations for multiple
          platforms<br></br><br></br><br></br>
          <h2>What is the difference between a web application and a website?</h2>
      <br></br>When the internet was newly invented, websites had significantly
       less functionality than web apps. They were only capable of delivering
        information to users through static content. You had to install and 
        run software with complex functionality. Web apps were built to
         bridge the gap between software and static sites. They had 
         functionality and interactive user elements like the software but 
         were delivered using a web browser URL. 

However, web technology has evolved significantly since then. Most modern 
websites are complex web applications in their design.
